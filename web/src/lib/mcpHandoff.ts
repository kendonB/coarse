// Handoff helpers for the "Review with my subscription" button on the
// coarse web form. The flow is:
//
//   1. User uploads PDF via /api/presign + direct Supabase Storage PUT
//      (same path as the regular OpenRouter review — no extraction
//      triggered).
//   2. User clicks "Review with Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI".
//   3. Frontend POSTs to /api/cli-handoff which mints a short-lived
//      finalize_token (3h, see FINALIZE_TOKEN_TTL_MINUTES) bound to
//      the paper_id and returns a handoff URL of the form
//      ``https://coarse.ink/h/<token>`` (or localhost in dev).
//   4. A modal renders the two commands the user pastes into their
//      terminal:
//        - one-time skill refresh: `uvx --python 3.12 --from ... coarse install-skills`
//        - the review: `uvx --python 3.12 --from ... coarse-review --handoff
//          <handoff-url> --host codex|claude|gemini [--model ...]
//          [--effort ...]`
//   5. The user's local `coarse-review` command:
//        a. Fetches the bundle from /h/<token> as JSON
//        b. Downloads the raw PDF from the signed URL inside the bundle
//        c. Extracts locally with their OpenRouter key (from
//           ~/.coarse/config.toml or .env)
//        d. Runs the full coarse pipeline, routing every LLM call
//           through the chosen headless CLI
//        e. POSTs the rendered review back to /api/mcp-finalize with
//           the finalize_token
//        f. Prints `https://coarse.ink/review/<paper_id>?token=<t>` —
//           the user clicks it to see the review in the normal web UI.
//           The tokened URL form is required because /api/presign sets
//           `access_token_required=true` on every review row; the
//           mcp-finalize response embeds a signed token so the `view:`
//           line is clickable without any additional token grafting.
//
// No server-side extraction. No OpenRouter key on the web backend. The
// handoff URL is the only thing that crosses the browser→terminal
// boundary, and it's copy-pasted from a modal.

    `Please review an academic paper for me using the coarse-review skill. ` +
    `The paper is a REMOTE resource — its source URL is already embedded ` +
    `in the command below. Do NOT search for a local PDF, do NOT ask me ` +
    `for a file path, and do NOT try to interpret the URL as a filename.\n\n` +
    `STEP 0 — Check whether \`uvx\` is available. Run ` +
    `\`command -v uvx || command -v uv\`. If neither command exists, ` +
    `install uv first with \`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\`, ` +
    `then run \`export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"\` in the current shell. ` +
    `coarse requires Python 3.12+, so if needed install it with ` +
    `\`uv python install 3.12\`. If \`uv\` exists but \`uvx\` does not, ` +
    `use \`uv tool run --python 3.12 --from ...\` ` +
    `wherever the steps below say \`uvx --python 3.12 --from ...\`. Do NOT get stuck on ` +
    `\`uvx: command not found\` or an older system Python.\n\n` +
    `STEP 1 — Refresh the coarse-review skill files. ` +
    `Run this command to copy the pinned coarse-review skill bundle into ` +
    `your Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI skill folder. This uses uvx, ` +
    `so it does not permanently install ` +
    `coarse-ink into your global environment. If the exact command below ` +
    `reports \`No such command 'install-skills'\`, that's a known ` +
    `version-skew and is safe to ignore — the review runs the same way ` +
    `either way because uvx is already loading the coarse bundle via ` +
    `\`--from\`.\n\n` +
    `${setupCmd}\n\n` +
    `STEP 2 — Check for an OpenRouter API key without printing its ` +
    `value. Prefer presence-only probes so the key doesn't needlessly ` +
    `show up in the chat transcript:\n\n` +
    `  test -n "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY" && echo "env: set" || echo "env: missing"\n` +
    `  test -f .env && grep -q '^OPENROUTER_API_KEY=' .env && echo ".env: set" || echo ".env: missing"\n\n` +
    `If neither probe reports "set", tell me:\n\n` +
    `  "I need an OpenRouter API key for the Mistral OCR extraction step ` +
    `(~$0.10 per paper). A few options:\n` +
    `   1. Paste the key here and I'll save it to ~/.coarse/config.toml ` +
    `via \`${configCmd}\`. Heads up that whatever you paste here passes ` +
    `through the LLM provider (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google), so treat ` +
    `the key as slightly less private than one you typed into a local ` +
    `terminal — rotate at https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys if that ` +
    `worries you.\n` +
    `   2. Set it yourself in a separate terminal and come back: ` +
    `\`export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...\` or add it to a \`.env\` ` +
    `file in your current directory.\n` +
    `   3. Run \`${configCmd}\` in a separate terminal yourself and ` +
    `paste the key into its interactive prompt — the key lands in ` +
    `~/.coarse/config.toml without touching this chat at all.\n` +
    `   Which do you want?"\n\n` +
    `If I paste the key into chat, just save it — run \`${configCmd}\` ` +
    `with the pasted value and confirm it's stored. No need to lecture ` +
    `me about it; I already know what I'm doing.\n\n` +
    `STEP 3 — Launch the detached review. Run the EXACT command below, ` +
    `verbatim. Do not substitute, rewrite, or interpret any argument — ` +
    `every piece is already filled in. The \`--handoff\` URL is the ` +
    `paper source; coarse-review downloads the paper from that URL ` +
    `over the network at the start of the pipeline. You do NOT need ` +
    `to, and MUST NOT, search the filesystem (no \`find\`, no ` +
    `\`glob\`, no \`ls /tmp\`, no \`FindFiles\`) for a local paper, ` +
    `and you do NOT need to ask me for a paper path. This command ` +
    `returns immediately (within 2 seconds) after printing ` +
    `\`Review PID: <N>\` and \`Log file: ${logFile}\`. Run it:\n\n` +
    `  ${runCmd}\n\n` +
    `STEP 4 — Wait for the review to finish with a single blocking ` +
    `bash call. The review takes 10-25 minutes end-to-end. Instead of ` +
    `polling \`tail\` every 60 seconds (which generates one permission ` +
    `prompt per poll), use coarse-review's built-in \`--attach\` ` +
    `watcher, which blocks in a single command until the worker ` +
    `exits:\n\n` +
    `  ${attachCmd}\n\n` +
    `The attach command streams the log to stdout as it's written and ` +
    `prints a \`[attach] pid=<N> elapsed=<mm:ss> — waiting…\` heartbeat ` +
    `every 30 seconds of log idleness so the bash tool sees stdout ` +
    `activity and doesn't think the command is hung. It exits ` +
    `automatically when the review process exits. IMPORTANT: run it ` +
    `with a long bash-tool timeout — at least **2700000 ms (45 min)** ` +
    `in Claude Code's \`Bash\` tool via the \`timeout\` parameter, ` +
    `\`--timeout 2700\` in Codex, or the equivalent in Gemini CLI. ` +
    `The 45-minute recommendation leaves ~20 minutes of margin on top ` +
    `of the 10-25 minute review runtime for cold starts, slow models, ` +
    `very long papers, and \`--effort xhigh\` runs. 30 minutes used to ` +
    `be the recommendation and it was tight — every agent's tool ` +
    `timeout is a wall clock, not an idle-stream cap, so a 25-minute ` +
    `review with a 30-minute cap leaves only 5 minutes of safety ` +
    `margin. Bump to 60 minutes if you're reviewing a book-length ` +
    `paper or you've picked the largest model. Do NOT re-run the ` +
    `\`--detach\` command from STEP 3 if the attach call returns ` +
    `early — that would spawn a second worker against the same ` +
    `handoff URL. If attach exits because the bash tool timed out ` +
    `(not because the review finished), just re-run the EXACT same ` +
    `attach command again — it's idempotent and will re-attach to ` +
    `the same running worker.\n\n` +
    `Attach exit codes tell you what happened:\n` +
    `  - 0 — review completed successfully, \`view:\` + \`local:\` ` +
    `lines are in the log\n` +
    `  - 1 — review reported a failure marker; show me the error from ` +
    `the log\n` +
    `  - 2 — review process died without a completion marker (silent ` +
    `crash); show me the last 50 log lines so I can diagnose\n` +
    `  - 3 — pidfile missing (launcher never started); re-run STEP 3\n` +
    `  - 124 — attach's own 30-min timeout tripped (very unusual); ` +
    `re-run the attach command to continue waiting\n\n` +
    `STEP 5 — When attach exits with code 0, read the completion ` +
    `footer from the log. Run \`rg '^  view:|^  local:' ${logFile}\`. ` +
    `The \`local:\` line is the exact markdown path written by ` +
    `coarse-review. If \`view:\` is present, it's the canonical web ` +
    `URL and already includes the signed access token — use it ` +
    `as-is. If the log says \`view: unavailable\`, report that the ` +
    `web callback failed and use only the \`local:\` path. Do NOT ` +
    `try to discover another web URL, and do NOT run broad ` +
    `\`find\`, \`locate\`, or \`lsof\` searches trying to rediscover ` +
    `the review file.\n\n` +
    `Note: this runs locally on my machine using my own Claude Code, ` +
    `Codex, or Gemini CLI account. coarse.ink does not receive or ` +
    `store my provider login, and my provider's terms, limits, and ` +
    `policies apply.\n\n` +
    `When attach has exited cleanly (code 0) and you've read the ` +
    `completion footer, show me:\n` +
    `  - The review URL (the \`view:\` line) — render it as a ` +
    `clickable markdown link like \`[Open review](\${viewUrl})\` so ` +
    `I can click it in the chat instead of copy-pasting. If the ` +
    `terminal environment and my platform clearly support it, also ` +
    `offer (don't execute without asking) to open the URL in my ` +
    `default browser — \`open "\${viewUrl}"\` on macOS, ` +
    `\`xdg-open "\${viewUrl}"\` on Linux, \`start "" "\${viewUrl}"\` ` +
    `on Windows. Skip the offer entirely in cloud sandbox sessions ` +
    `where there is no graphical display.\n` +
    `  - The local markdown path (the \`local:\` line)\n` +
    `  - A summary of the recommendation (accept / revise / reject)\n` +
    `  - The top 3 macro issues from the overview section`
