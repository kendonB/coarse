# Deploying coarse

The web app runs on four free services:

| Service | Role | Free tier |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Vercel** | Frontend + `/api/submit` | 100 GB bandwidth, 10s function timeout |
| **Supabase** | PostgreSQL + file storage | 500 MB DB, 1 GB storage, 50K MAU |
| **Modal** | Serverless Python worker | $30/month compute credits |
| **Gmail** | Email notifications | 500 emails/day (app password) |

Users provide their own OpenRouter API key, which covers **everything**: review agents, literature search, and Mistral OCR for PDF extraction (all routed through OpenRouter's file-parser plugin). The operator pays only for Modal compute (~$0.08–0.10 per review) and Gmail SMTP.

---

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repo (public, for free GitHub Actions)
- Accounts on: [Supabase](https://supabase.com), [Modal](https://modal.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- A Gmail account with an App Password for notification emails
- A shared secret for the Modal webhook (`python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`)

No LLM provider API keys are needed on the deployment side — users supply their own.

---

## 1. Supabase

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Open the **SQL Editor** and paste the contents of `deploy/supabase_schema.sql`. Run it.
   - This creates the `reviews` table, enables RLS, creates the `papers` storage bucket, and enables Realtime.
3. Go to **Settings → API** and copy:
   - **Project URL** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon public key** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **service_role secret key** → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

The `reviews` table stores review metadata and results. PDFs are uploaded to the `papers` storage bucket and deleted immediately after processing.

**Access control**: The UUID primary key is unguessable (2^122 possible values) and serves as the access token. No login system needed. RLS allows anyone to read a review if they have the UUID; only the service key can write.

---

## 2. Modal

1. Install and authenticate:
   ```bash
   pip install modal
   modal setup
   ```

2. Create secrets in the [Modal dashboard](https://modal.com/secrets) — one secret group per service:

   | Secret name | Environment variables |
   |-------------|----------------------|
   | `coarse-supabase` | `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` |
   | `coarse-webhook` | `MODAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (generate: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`) |
   | `coarse-gmail` | `GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, `SITE_URL` (e.g. `https://coarse.vercel.app`) |

   **No LLM provider secrets are mounted.** The user's OpenRouter key arrives with each review request and is set into the container's env for the duration of the run, then unset. See `modal_worker.py` for the pattern.

3. Deploy via CI, not manually. The Modal worker is auto-deployed from
   `main` by `.github/workflows/modal-deploy.yml` on every push that
   touches `src/coarse/**`, `deploy/modal_worker.py`, `pyproject.toml`,
   or the workflow file itself. You should almost never run `modal
   deploy` by hand.

   First-time setup requires two GitHub Actions repo secrets: create a
   Modal token locally with `modal token new`, then:
   ```bash
   gh secret set MODAL_TOKEN_ID --body <id>
   gh secret set MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET --body <secret>
   ```

   After that, every merge to `main` that changes a deploy-relevant
   file will auto-redeploy. You can also trigger a manual re-run via
   `gh workflow run modal-deploy.yml` or the GitHub Actions tab.

   **Emergency manual deploy** (only when `main` is broken and you
   need to ship a hotfix from a branch; use sparingly):
   ```bash
   COARSE_MODAL_DEPLOY_FORCE=1 modal deploy deploy/modal_worker.py
   ```
   Without the `COARSE_MODAL_DEPLOY_FORCE=1` env var, the import-time
   guard in `deploy/modal_worker.py::_enforce_deploy_branch()` refuses
   to deploy from any branch other than `main`. This guard exists
   because on 2026-04-13 a `modal deploy` from a `dev` checkout
   shipped resurrected cheap-tier stage routing plus an api-key race
   to production, breaking every review for hours.

4. Copy the webhook URL from the output (visible in the Actions run
   logs, or on the Modal dashboard). It looks like:
   ```
   https://<your-org>--coarse-review-run-review.modal.run
   ```

5. Verify the health endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl https://<your-org>--coarse-review-health.modal.run
   # → {"status": "ok", "service": "coarse-review"}
   ```

**How the worker runs**: When triggered by the frontend, it downloads the PDF from Supabase Storage, calls `coarse.review_paper()` with the user's OpenRouter key, writes the review markdown back to Supabase, sends a completion email, and deletes the PDF. Timeout is 10 minutes, memory is 512 MB.

---

## 3. Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import the GitHub repo
   - Vercel auto-detects Next.js and configures the build
   - Set the **Root Directory** to `web/`

2. Add environment variables in **Settings → Environment Variables**:

   | Variable | Value | Notes |
   |----------|-------|-------|
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://xxx.supabase.co` | From step 1 |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `eyJ...` | From step 1 |
   | `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | `eyJ...` | From step 1 (server-side only) |
   | `MODAL_FUNCTION_URL` | `https://...modal.run` | From step 2 |
   | `MODAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | (same value as Modal secret) | Shared secret |
   | `GMAIL_USER` | `your@gmail.com` | Gmail address for sending |
   | `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx` | Gmail app password |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `https://coarse.vercel.app` | Your public URL |

3. Deploy. The site will be live at `https://coarse.vercel.app` (or a custom domain if configured).

---

## 4. Keep-Alive Cron

Supabase free tier pauses the database after 7 days of inactivity. A GitHub Actions workflow pings it every 5 days to prevent this.

The workflow is already at `.github/workflows/keepalive.yml`. You just need to add two **GitHub repo secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | `https://xxx.supabase.co` |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `eyJ...` (the anon key, not the service key) |

---

## 5. Email (Optional)

Email notifications use Gmail with an app password. To set up:

1. Use or create a Gmail account for sending
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on the account
3. Go to [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) and generate a new app password
4. Set `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` in both Vercel and Modal secrets

Gmail app passwords support ~500 emails/day, which covers ~250 reviews/day. If you need more volume, swap to a transactional email service (Resend, SES, etc.).

## Data Flow

```
User submits PDF + email + OpenRouter key
  │
  ▼
Vercel: POST /api/submit
  ├── INSERT into Supabase reviews table → gets UUID
  ├── Upload PDF to Supabase Storage as {uuid}.pdf
  ├── POST to Modal webhook with {uuid, pdf_path, api_key, email}
  ├── Send confirmation email (Gmail)
  └── Return { id: uuid } → redirect to /status/{uuid}
  │
  ▼
Modal worker (async, up to 10 min)
  ├── Download PDF from Supabase Storage
  ├── Run coarse.review_paper() with user's OpenRouter key
  ├── UPDATE reviews SET status='done', result_markdown=...
  ├── Delete PDF from Supabase Storage
  └── Send completion email (Gmail)
  │
  ▼
User views /review/{uuid}
  ├── Supabase Realtime subscription for live status
  └── Renders review markdown (react-markdown + KaTeX)
```

---

## Review Key

The review key is a UUID v4, generated by Supabase on row insert. It serves as:
- The database primary key
- The access token (no auth system — the UUID is unguessable)
- The URL path: `/review/{uuid}` and `/status/{uuid}`

Users receive the key:
1. Immediately after submission (shown on the status page)
2. In the confirmation email
3. In the completion email

They can paste it into the "Find a review" box on the homepage at any time.

---

## Security

- **User API keys**: passed to Modal via HTTPS, used for one review, cleared from the container environment afterward. Never stored in the database.
- **PDFs**: deleted from Supabase Storage immediately after processing. No retention.
- **Reviews**: stored in Supabase. Readable by anyone with the UUID. Writable only via service key.
- **Modal webhook**: authenticated with a shared secret (`MODAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).
- **Supabase service key**: only used server-side (Vercel API route + Modal worker). Never exposed to the browser.

## Cost Estimate

| Volume | Infrastructure | Operator LLM (OCR + QA) | Total |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------|-------|
| 0–50 reviews/mo | $0 | $1–3.50 | **$1–4** |
| 50–100 | $0 | $2–7 | **$2–7** |
| 100–500 | $0 | $4–35 | **$4–35** |
| 500+ | Modal may exceed free tier | $10–35 | Upgrade Modal |

## Local Development

```bash
cd web/
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Fill in real values (or dummy values for frontend-only testing)
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

The frontend works locally without Supabase/Modal — form submission will fail but you can develop the UI.

## Troubleshooting

**"Failed to create review record"**: Supabase project is paused or env vars are wrong. Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`.

**"Failed to start review"**: Modal webhook URL is wrong or the worker isn't deployed. Check the most recent `deploy-modal` workflow run in GitHub Actions and verify with the health endpoint. Do not `modal deploy` manually unless `main` is broken — see step 3.

**Review stuck on "queued"**: Modal worker crashed or timed out. Check Modal logs at [modal.com/apps](https://modal.com/apps).

**No emails received**: Check that `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` are set in both Vercel and Modal. Verify the app password is valid at [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords). Check spam folders.

**Database paused**: Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) dashboard and click "Restore". Ensure the keep-alive cron is running (check GitHub Actions).
