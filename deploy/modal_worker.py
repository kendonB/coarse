"""Modal worker for coarse web reviews.

Deploys a serverless function that runs paper reviews triggered by the web frontend.
The web endpoint accepts requests and immediately spawns a background worker via
Modal's .spawn(), returning a fast 202 response. The background worker downloads
the PDF, runs the review pipeline, and writes results back to Supabase.

Deploy: DO NOT run `modal deploy` manually under normal circumstances.
The Modal worker is auto-deployed from `main` by
`.github/workflows/modal-deploy.yml` on every push to `main`. The local
import-time guard in `_enforce_deploy_branch()` below refuses to deploy
from any branch other than `main` unless `COARSE_MODAL_DEPLOY_FORCE=1`
is set (emergency escape hatch only).

Secrets: Create in Modal dashboard:
  coarse-supabase     SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
  coarse-webhook      MODAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  coarse-resend       RESEND_API_KEY  (sending-access key scoped to coarse.ink)

# Deploy-branch guardrail (issue: cheap-tier routing regression, 2026-04-13).
#
# On 2026-04-13, production Modal was running a snapshot of `dev` that
# contained the resurrected cheap-tier stage-routing code plus an
# api-key-at-call-time race. Both bugs existed only on `dev`; `main` was
# clean. The reason production was running `dev` at all was that there
# was no guardrail: `modal deploy` just ships whatever `src/coarse/` is
# on disk at the moment the command runs, and whoever deployed happened
# to have `dev` checked out.
#
# This guard runs at module import time — the first thing Modal does
# when you run `modal deploy deploy/modal_worker.py` — and refuses to
# proceed unless the working tree is on `main`. CI (`.github/workflows/
# modal-deploy.yml`) is the real enforcement; this function is the local
# belt that catches accidental laptop deploys. GitHub Actions only
# triggers on `push` to `main`, so `GITHUB_REF_NAME` is always `main`
# there and the guard is a no-op in CI.
#
# The guard is skipped in three cases:
#
# 1. Inside a Modal container at review-serving time (`modal.is_local()`
#    is False). The serverless functions re-import this file on every
#    cold start — refusing based on branch would break every review.
# 2. Inside a pytest session. `tests/test_modal_worker.py` loads this
#    file via `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`, and tests run
#    on every branch (including feature branches).
# 3. When the working tree isn't a git repo at all (e.g. PyPI install).
#    Emergency escape hatch: set `COARSE_MODAL_DEPLOY_FORCE=1` to bypass
#    when `main` is broken and you have to ship a hotfix from a
#    branch. The warning is written to stderr so it's visible in a
#    terminal scroll.
